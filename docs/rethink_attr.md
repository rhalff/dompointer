Rethink @attr.


They should not end up in refs
Should not endup as alias?

only end up in this.aliases

not in alias.

should end up in 'change'

should be understood by data()

bottem line, @ is a directive.

first part should be know, the path itself, never alias or store a ref with @.

headerTitle = ':0:1@id'

is ok for an alias but it should only end up in the this.aliases map for translation.

internally we only must deal with html elements.

When that is fixed.
I want the rendering improved.
